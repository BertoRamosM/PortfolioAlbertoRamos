## The Aesthetics of Tailwind Classes
When reading developer opinion about tailwind, it's often criticized by its amount of classes one after another, the ugliness of them and how confusing they look when looking at code written with it. Just overwhelming at first
<br>
But if so, why there are many big and small projects using it?

## The Power Behind the "Ugliness"
The answer it's experience. Once you get use to this ugliness, Tailwind becomes powerfull by its utility-first approach and consistency. By providing those 'ready-to-use' classes, it eliminates the need for (also extremely confusing) CSS classes, speeds up development, and ensures a uniform design across projects. 


```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 shadow-md rounded-lg p-6 md:p-8 lg:p-10 mb-4">
